# Customer Persona Feedback: Sofia's Analysis

**Date:** January 2, 2026
**Persona:** Sofia - Color-driven, creative woman (25-45) seeking bold pop art for her home

---

## Executive Summary

Sofia would browse the site, possibly add items to cart, but **hesitate at checkout**. The design is appealing but key trust signals and visualization tools are missing.

- **For prints (800-1500 kr):** Would buy IF room mockups + working Vipps + clear shipping shown
- **For originals (15,000+ kr):** Site alone wouldn't convince her - needs reviews, more detail

---

## Why Sofia WOULD Buy

| Strength | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Bold visual identity | Pink-on-black stands out from typical art sites |
| Clean, modern interface | Smooth animations feel premium |
| Clear pricing | No hunting for costs, VAT included |
| Mobile-friendly | Swipe gestures on gallery work well |
| Norwegian-first | Feels local, not a translated international site |
| Collection filtering | Easy to browse by theme |

## Why Sofia Would NOT Buy (Blockers)

| Blocker | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| No room mockups | Can't visualize art on her wall - **biggest blocker** |
| Hidden shipping costs | "Calculated after order" causes cart abandonment |
| No customer reviews | Zero social proof for legitimacy |
| Vipps button broken | Preferred payment shows "Coming soon" - hurts trust |
| No return policy visible | Too risky for expensive purchases |
| Placeholder content | Artist photo missing, site feels unfinished |
| No trust badges | No Stripe logo, secure checkout icons |
| No size context | "60x80 cm" means nothing without visual reference |

## Prioritized TODO List

### Critical (Must Fix Before Launch)

- [ ] **Add room mockups / wall visualization for products**
  - Show art on walls in different room settings
  - This is the biggest conversion blocker for online art sales

- [ ] **Fix shipping cost transparency**
  - Show shipping cost upfront OR display "Fri frakt over X kr" threshold
  - Hidden costs kill conversions

- [ ] **Complete Vipps integration or remove the button**
  - A broken payment option hurts trust more than not having it

- [ ] **Add a clear "Shop Now" CTA on the hero**
  - Guide users to products immediately

- [ ] **Replace placeholder images**
  - Artist photo on hero and "About" section must have real content

### High Priority

- [ ] **Add customer reviews/testimonials**
  - Even 3-5 quotes with photos of art in homes would help

- [ ] **Show return policy in checkout flow**
  - "14-day returns" badge builds confidence

- [ ] **Add "Quick Add" for prints on product cards**
  - Lower friction for impulse purchases

- [ ] **Create size comparison visuals**
  - Show dimensions relative to furniture or a person

- [ ] **Add related products / "Complete the Look"**
  - Cross-sell opportunity on product pages

### Medium Priority

- [ ] **Add Instagram feed integration**
  - Social proof and fresh content automatically

- [ ] **Show limited edition numbering for prints**
  - "Print 47/100" adds exclusivity

- [ ] **Add sorting options to shop page**
  - Price, newest, popularity

- [ ] **Include material/framing information**
  - What is the customer actually receiving?

- [ ] **Add payment security badges**
  - Stripe, secure checkout icons

- [ ] **Hide admin link from customer-facing header**
  - This looks unprofessional

### Nice to Have

- [ ] Add wishlist/favorites functionality
- [ ] Sticky add-to-cart button on mobile product pages
- [ ] Animated "new arrival" badge for recent products
- [ ] Artist video or behind-the-scenes content

## Page-by-Page Feedback

### Homepage

**Good:**
- Dark theme with hot pink feels bold and different
- Gradient text effect is modern and eye-catching
- Halftone pattern is a nice pop-art touch
- "Pop-art med personlighet" speaks to the target audience

**Needs Work:**
- Artist image is placeholder - feels unfinished
- No clear CTA on hero section
- Subtitle is generic ("Unique artworks...") - what makes Dotty different?
- No social proof (Instagram feed, customer photos, reviews)

### Shop Page

**Good:**
- Filter tabs are clean and centered
- Product cards have nice hover animations (lift + pink glow)
- Clear "Original" vs "Trykk" badges
- Low stock warnings create urgency without being pushy
- Price is immediately visible

**Needs Work:**
- No "Quick Add to Cart" on product cards
- No sorting options (price, newest, etc.)
- Sold overlay could be more visually interesting

### Product Pages

**Good:**
- Image is big and front-center
- Swipe gestures on mobile feel native
- "Added to cart" confirmation gives instant feedback
- Price is huge and clear
- Pink CTA button pops against dark background

**Needs Work:**
- NO room view / mockup showing art on a wall (CRITICAL)
- No scale comparison for dimensions
- No materials/frame options mentioned
- No related products section
- Description can be empty, making page feel sparse

### Cart & Checkout

**Good:**
- Slide-out cart is smooth
- Cart items show images and quantities
- "inkl. MVA" transparency appreciated
- Discount code field visible
- Vipps button exists (intent is good)

**Needs Work:**
- Vipps shows "Coming soon" - frustrating
- Shipping cost says "calculated after order" - NO
- No estimated delivery time
- No free shipping threshold shown
- No guest checkout option mentioned
- No payment security badges

## Trust Score by Area

| Area | Score | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Homepage | 6/10 | Good design, but placeholder content hurts trust |
| Shop browsing | 7/10 | Professional grid, filters work, pricing transparent |
| Product pages | 5/10 | Cannot visualize art in space - major issue |
| Checkout | 5/10 | Too many unknowns (shipping, delivery time) |
| Trust signals | 4/10 | No reviews, no return policy, no security badges |
| Mobile | 7/10 | Good responsive design, swipe works well |

---

## Final Verdict

> "The design is cool and the art seems interesting, but I can't visualize it in my home, I don't know how much shipping costs, and Vipps doesn't work. Priority 1 action: Add room visualization images. This single change would dramatically increase my confidence in buying."

2. Add return policy text to checkout page
3. Hide admin link from public navigation
